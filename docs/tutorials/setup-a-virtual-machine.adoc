A virtual machine that can be used on your local computer is useful when
developing scripts for a server that is managed with Chillbox. This guide will
use two tools to accomplish this: Vagrant, and VirtualBox as they have binaries
available for multiple platforms. At the end of this tutorial you'll have an
Alpine Linux server that can be used for the rest of the tutorials.
