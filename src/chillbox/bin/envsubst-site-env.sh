A envsubst wrapper to replace variables in stdin with what was defined in the
'env' of a chillbox site configuration file (.site.json). The stdout will be the
replaced text. The variables that will be replaced will also include the
following list and these are required to be set and exported.

    $env_names

Usage:
  $script_name -h
  cat file-with-env-vars.txt | $script_name [<options>] > file.txt

Options:
  -h                  Show this help message.

  -c <config-file>    Path to a chillbox site configuration file (.site.json).

Variables:
  ENV_FILE
  CHILLBOX_CONFIG_FILE
