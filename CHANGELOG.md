## [initial-shell-implementation]

Chillbox was initially implemented as a very opinionated solution to provision
and maintain a [DigitalOcean] droplet server and surrounding infrastructure. It
was tightly coupled with the deployment of websites, which used custom
configuration in JSON files. That initial solution is on this other git branch:
[initial-shell-implementation].
It was restructured since then to be more maintainable and easier to understand
by breaking it up into individual pieces that could be used together.
