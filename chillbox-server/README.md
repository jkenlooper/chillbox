# Chillbox Server

**_Work in Progress_.** The chillbox-server was split off from the original
implementation on this git branch: 
[initial-shell-implementation](https://github.com/jkenlooper/chillbox/tree/initial-shell-implementation).

...

TODO: Move scripts and other files from old_sh/ directory to this one.

Create a script that takes a directory path as an arg to build and copy over
files to a project directory. The chillbox.toml in that project directory should
then be updated to use those files with 'chillbox-server:' prefix.

Move:

- old_sh/build
- old_sh/src/chillbox
- old_sh/src/terraform
